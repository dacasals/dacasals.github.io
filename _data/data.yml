        company: 'Cornershop By Uber, Chile'
        details: |
          Designed, developed, and deployed a large-scale recommender solution to address the Product Replacement problem
          in the grocery business.
          - Implemented 3 ML solutions combining heuristics, and deep learning models to 
          recommend replacements for OutOfStock products, with a significative impact on business KPIs like
           replacement rate and fulfillment rate.
          - Conducted effective A/B experiments and data analysis to verify the impact of ML solutions, debugging,
           and take actions to improve
          models and recommendations quality.
          - Implemented enhancements to data pipelines used across various business areas to increase their
           reliability and fault tolerance,  reducing the need for manual intervention in many model training 
           and deployments as well as ensuring smoother operations overall.

        company: 'Cornershop By Uber, Chile'
        details: |
          - Implemented a Rest API (using lightweight 
          framework Sanic) to abstract access to ML models from the Cornershop backend,
           enhancing the integration process and enabling the availability of
            recommendation services instead of direct model access.
            
            It included:

            - functionalities for logging input/outputs to unlock fine-grade monitoring capabilities.
            - internal REST routes to manage configuration like active models, balance request rates
            per model within a service, and choose a model given input features, among others.
            - A UI interface using React to allow visual configuration.
            - an OpenAPI 3.0 specification describing API REST services to ensure ease of use and 
            accessibility for team members involved in model integration.
          
          - Integrated many of the recommendation models delivered by the team into the API,
            demonstrating competence in shaping REST service, fast prototyping, and supervising the implementation
             process using best practices in ML model integration and API development.
          - Successfully expedited the integration of machine learning (ML) models into the API, 
          demonstrating an ability to efficiently coordinate requirements and usage details with platform consumers of the API services
           to ensure smooth integration processes. During this period I acted as the main point of contact
            between platform consumers of the API services and Data Scientists of the team.
          
          - Implemented data pipelines with Airflow and Glue to transform the API logs into structured data queryable with SQL,
           necessary to debug models and analyze their impact on the business.
          - Contribute to improving MLOps stack tools used by the team.
        # Worked actively shaping both, the Api model integration as well as the integrations with the api in the Cornershop
        #  platform.
